# Testing Effects on Time Complexity Emperically

Done for a class assignment, emperical testing on the difference between iterative & recursive design will be done with time outputs to a .csv file

- Compares a few implementations for implementing a x to the power of function that uses different types
- Outputs the different time values for running each to a csv file for further analysis
